TechHive User Management API

TechHive is a .NET 9.0 ASP.NET Core Web API for user management, built with clean architecture and an in-memory database. It features secure, token-based authentication, robust validation, and a layered design for maintainability. All endpoints require authentication, and the API includes automatic data seeding, comprehensive logging, and global error handling. Developers can explore and test the API using Swagger UI or HTTP files, with full support for unit and integration testing. TechHive is ideal for learning modern API patterns and best practices in .NET.
