            <h1>TechHive Solutions User Management API (Controller)</h1>
            <p>
                This project is a User Management API that uses an ASP.NET Core Controller API for TechHive Solutions.
                It enables TechHive's HR and IT departments to create, update, retrieve, and delete user records
                efficiently.

            <p>
                Regarding how Copilot was used in this project's development process, transcriptions of the prompts
                that were used and the conversations that occurred were captured and saved in text files. These files
                can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnetmurf/TechHiveAPI/tree/master/wwwroot/docs"
                    target="_blank">/wwwroot/docs</a> folder in the project's Github repository.

            <h3>Alternative Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                This API was built as an alternative implementation to the original TechHive Solutions User Management
                API, which was developed using a Minimal API approach. The Minimal API version was developed as a
                three-part final project for the <a
                    href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-development-with-dotnet?specialization=microsoft-full-stack-developer"
                    target="_blank">"Back-End Development with .NET"</a>
                course with a focus on leveraging Microsoft Copilot for code generation, enhancement, and debugging. The
                project requirements can be viewed <a href="docs/project-requirements.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>Testing with Swagger UI</h2>
            <p>
                To test the API endpoints, you can use the Swagger UI interface that is automatically generated for the
                API. However, an authorization token will be required to access the endpoints. To send the authorization
                token in Swagger UI, follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Click <a href="swagger" target="_blank">here</a> to open Swagger UI in a new page (usually at
                    /swagger or /swagger/index.html).</li>
                <li>Click the "Authorize" button (often a lock icon at the top right).</li>
                <li>In the value field, enter: <strong>TechHive2024SecureToken</strong></li>
                <li>Click "Authorize" and then "Close".</li>
            </ol>
            Now, all your API requests from Swagger UI will include the authorization header with your token.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other tools like Postman can also be used to test the API endpoints by including the authorization token
                in the headers. Full Test Coverage is also available if using the application in an IDE. Please see the
                <strong><em>Testing</em></strong> section in the README.md file for more
                details.
            </p>
            <h2>Resetting the List of Users (user store)</h2>
            <p>
                The API exposes an POST endpoint (/api/Data/seed) to reset the user store to its initial state. You can
                use the Swagger UIinterface that is automatically generated for the API to call this endpoint if a reset
                of the user store
                is needed.
